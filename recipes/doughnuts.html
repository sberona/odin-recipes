        <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1/3 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons vanilla</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons hot water or as needed</li>
    </ul>

<h2 class="dir">Directions</h2>
<p>Now it's finally time to start making thede delicious doughnuts. Put on your aprons and get ready to bake!</p>
<ol>
    <li>Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water, and let stand for 5 minutes, or until foamy.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, mix together the yeast mixture, milk, sugar, salt, eggs, shortening, and 2 cups of the flour. Mix for a few minutes at low speed, 
        or stirring with a wooden spoon. Beat in remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough no longer sticks to the bowl. Knead for about 5 minutes, 
        or until smooth and elastic. Place the dough into a greased bowl, and cover. Set in a warm place to rise until double. Dough is ready if you touch it, 
        and the indention remains.</li>
    <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and gently roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut with a floured doughnut cutter. Let doughnuts sit out to 
        rise again until double. Cover loosely with a cloth.</li>    
     <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Remove from heat, and stir in hot water one 
         tablespoon at a time until the icing is somewhat thin, but not watery. Set aside.</li>  
    <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slide doughnuts into the hot oil using a wide spatula. Turn doughnuts
         over as they rise to the surface. Fry doughnuts on each side until golden brown. Remove from hot oil, to drain on a wire rack. Dip doughnuts into the 
         glaze while still hot, and set onto wire racks to drain off excess. Keep a cookie sheet or tray under racks for easier clean up.</li>      
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount
     may vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used.</p>
     <p>And just like that, you have an amazing batch of glazed doughnuts! It may not be Krispy Kreme but boy is it a contender.</p>
