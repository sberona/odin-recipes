<strong>My very first web project!</strong>

<p>This is my very first web project and in this project I will be making a recipes website. It will be a basic recipes website (nothing to fancy for now). The website will consist of the main index page with links to the recipes. This is an HTML project, so this won't be the fanciest looking website but later on we can come back to it and clean it up with CSS. Once the project is completed, I will come back with a self-reflection about the entire project.</p>

<strong>Self-Reflection</strong>

<p>So I finished my very first web project. This was my first HTML project and I had lots of fun completing the project. Overall it took me probably about 2 hours to complete the entire project. I didn't find the project too complicating, it was just a lot of typing. Throughout completing the project I used my basic HTML skills like putting images, links, etc. and using tags like bold tags, italic tags, paragraph tags, etc. I also used many of the git commands and personally I don't know why, but I feel like I struggled more on using the git commands than the actual project itself but in the end I was able to understand how the git workflow works. Overall it was a fun project to do and hopefully in the future once I learn CSS, I can return to this project and make it look even 10x better than it is now!
